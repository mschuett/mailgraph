# H1 My mailgraph patch

This is a small [mailgraph patch](http://mschuette.name/files/mailgraph-1.14-rejectreasons.diff) I maintain for some time now.
It adds regexps and counters for different reject reasons.

It supports my own setup, i.e. [postgrey](http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/) and [policyd-weight](http://www.policyd-weight.org/) messages.
